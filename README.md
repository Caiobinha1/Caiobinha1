 <summary><h3>ðŸ“‚ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  My dad always encouraged me to start coding from a young age, but it wasn't until I was 16 that I had my first "Introduction to C/C++" classâ€”and I instantly fell in love with programming. From that moment, I began taking online courses, learning a little more every day to work toward my goal of becoming a developer.

After two years of studying, I landed my first job as a Software Developer, where I worked with databases using SQL and Delphi. Now, I'm in college, exploring new programming languages and expanding my skill set every day!
