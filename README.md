 <summary><h3>ðŸ“‚ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  My dad always tried to convince me to start coding since I was very young, but it wasn't until I was 16 that I had my first "Introduction to c/c++", and just fell in love with the idea of one day becoming a developer. After that, I started doing some online classes to keep learning a little everyday so one day I could achieve my goals, after 2 years studying I got my first Software Devoloper job and there I was taught to work with databases using SQL and Delphi, and now Im in college studying new programming languages everyday!
